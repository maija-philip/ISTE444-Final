## How to run

1. Create a `.env` file in the `./server-layer`
    Must have: 
    ```
    SESSION_SECRET="CRUD-COWS"
    ```

2. cd into `./frontend` and run `npm run build`
3. cd into `../server` and run `node server.js`
4. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) 


## Editing the frontend

Run the frontend by cd-ing into `frontend` and running `npm start` \
\
This will start the frontend in development mode in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
\
Your changes will automatically show up here. When you are done, run `npm run build` then restart the server and you will be able to see your frontend changes there too.
